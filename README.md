## Technology

Designed for the DILIGENT REMOTE ACCESS of and interaction of situations such as financial data and [pixel art, in a gallery](https://wallet.crypto.red/gallery) with an ease and eye-comfort of use without any comparable predecessor.

It embedded a GREAT MEMORY, a CLIENT DATABASE in other words with up to 11GB available, along with multiple (service) workers enabling multi-threading for a faster and more convenient use of web technologies related to canvas and its offscreen version.

Every pixel art, which is by essence, a relatively NEW FORM OF ART, which can be created through [the pixel art editor](https://wallet.crypto.red/pixel) featuring powerful I-2-PA technologies developed from scratch by the main developer and is STORED ENTIRELY on the Hive BLOCKCHAIN, this guarantying a nearly 100% chance of surviving* against censorship, ages, accidental suppression, and other situations threatening those data belonging to you among other users.

Hive features FREE, somehow limited, somehow heavy, 3 SECONDS block's transactions in which are stored your art and user profile for the part of the application looking like popular social media platforms, meanwhile your other crypto-accounts are using a seed always stored in your browser which you can choose to encrypt with a layering of powerful POST-QUANTUM algorithms for you to not mind who could access your account if it has an access to your computer, so you can share it without worrying.

The application features links for remote blending swap, trading, and buying of multiple cryptographic-currencies along with two main tools: a QR-CODE scanner, and a tool for the ENCRYPTION of messages and memo on other chains such as those mentioned above which are ready to be used in the application.

Thanks to TensorFlow, It also features AI and MACHINE LEARNING for prevent toxic content from being posted by its users which would include threats...

"Making the metaverse along with daily life a creative experience, continually ORIGINAL-DELUSIONAL-ECSTATIC."

## Information about the pixel art gallery

The only way to create a natural exhibition of the current world is to take the notion of the macrostate which you are belonging to into your own heart, and redesign it to suit your own mind.

Now, in broader terms, "redesigning it" tells that our future will be the "creation and collection of situations for nothing"... But it will be situations and in such case those situations, the whole of the pixel art picture, the event description, comments wrapped around it, make it be a situation of art, not a sword of death, which can be part of the real world or of the metaverse, and whoever may critizise your own art tell his own mind what he has choosen to care of nothingness instead of himself.

Now, science is merely a desire of man to understand and remember the ever complementing parts of himself giving him the knowledge that what he can see taste or feel, simply are electrical signals interpreted by his brains. And god is transcendent, right? So, what happens if you believe god is a machine or an interface, our norms are power rights? So to be, our god can become human again when it share art with its functionning element of himself, a blockchain should be more friendly and artistic, to be broeader accepted by us, humans. Art is more human than science, it is also more profitable, to say it better.

They, (the haters) not only want to deny art but as the global delusional / delirious state of mind is spreading more and more in the real world with the "metaverse" tunneling effect we also say it widely and openly to achieve our goal together , improvements in information technology using the metaverse experience and the real-life tools we possess. It is like to told one the fun fact that: "making daily life a creative experience, continually original-delusional-ecstatic", is a difficult process but a powerful thing.

But just like IF WE WERE in a situation of a cold war, declared between crypto and banking our technological and engineering skills would have to be exploited to the maximum. And with that, you are with me, a master piece of the system in what is open-source, it is the computer code but also what will follow, so these are new technologies to make human life easier with the precense of machines, think, cars, coffee machines, telephones, everything from one source. Everything that keeps us company and keeps us from "wasting time on small and light things" was designed somewhere else, in the brain, that's where all the magic happens.

Whoever you may be, a mad cryptokuza or a former bankster, You can enjoy this platform through this site with ease and without the deep fear of the unknown unartistic unworthy situations of the metaverse and daily life.

And with Information Technology, we, as contributors, started to not be denied or abandoned by our idea.

**And with IT, we, as contributors, started to:**

 * Counter quantum-computer.
 * Displace FIAT currency.
 * Disrupt theoretical monopoly over mainstream social media.
 * Bring back power to the people trough autonomy and algorithms.
 * Not be denied. Dissuade others.
